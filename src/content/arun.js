      It's a RTC application built using web sockets and WebRTC concepts where our teacher and students can join in a live online AV classroom. The teachers can share their screens , load their content to be taught (in the form of ppt) in the whiteboard , annotate with the tools like free line, shape drawer, eraser, marker.
